# Tests
The comparison tests were focused on the difficulty differences between the NTSC-U/C and NTSC-J versions of the game which impact speedrunning.
Two components were tested:
- Enemy damage output: How much damage does the drone do to the player's health with one hit? The tests were done on the first level using the red flying drone enemies, as they deal more damage than the blue walker enemies in the second level.
- Player damage output: How many hits does the player need with the rifle to destroy the drone? The tests were done on the second level using the blue walker enemies, as they take more hits than the red flying drone enemies in the first level.
The tests were also done both with and without the easy mode input.
The hard mode input was disregarded for the tests, as it's unclear how properly apply it and it's also irrelevant for speedrunning.

# Results
## NTSC-U/C version
### Enemy damage output
- Normal mode: 120
- Easy mode: 60
### Player damage output
- Normal mode: 3
- Easy mode: 2

## NTSC-J version
### Enemy damage output
- Normal mode: 24
- Easy mode: 12
### Player damage output
- Normal mode: 3
- Easy mode: 2

## Other findings
- Enemies span way more different in the two versions. The enemies in the NTSC-J version initially spawn in fixed locations in low numbers. Additional spawns after an enemy was killed are not immediately, but as in the NTSC-U/C seem to be in random locations. In the NTSC-U/C version enemies seem to spawn completely at random in random locations, in way higher numbers. It seems that it's not even needed to kill an enemy for a new one to spawn.
- Enemy health in the NTSC-J version seems to be influenced by the current level. The red flying drone enemies took one hit on level one and two on level two, both on normal mode. This seems to not be the case for the NTSC-U/C version, instead they overall seem to have way more health from the get go.
- Some enemies seem to have additional ways to annoy you in the NTSC-U/C from the get go as well, like the blue walker enemies being able to dodge.

# Conclusions
It is pretty clear that the NTSC-J is the preferred version for speedrunning.
The difference in enemy damage output is unreasonable, just multiplying numbers by five is an "interesting" approach to make a game more challenging.
Also as for some levels the enemy healthy seems to be way lower than in later levels in the NTSC-J version, also including easier enemy behaviors, this clearly makes the decision which version to run easier.
Easy mode does the same in both versions and should be the preferred way to speedrun the game regardless of version.
